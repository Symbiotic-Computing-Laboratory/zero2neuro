# Saved Results
## Xlsx Spreadsheet
Zero2Neuro supports creating xlsx spreadsheets for result viewing. These reports can be divided into six different sheets and serve as a more accessible way to view an experiment's parameters and evaluations. The report can be enabled by parsing in the argument `--report`.
## Pickle File
The pickle file contains very detailed information based off the arguments provided. It can log the training/validation/testing sets, prediction values, and etc. Viewing this pickle file requires outside code, pickle viewers are included in the example problems for Zero2Neuro. 
## Keras File
The trained model can be saved as a keras model, which enables the ability to use a trained model for future experiments.
