# Network Builder

TODO: intro material

## Description

The Network Builder module is in charge of creating the model's
network. It does this by taking in user-defined arguments and using
keras3_tools to create either fully connected networks or
convolutional neural networks.  

## Key Concepts

### Individual neurons

linear transformation + non-linearities

### Non-linearities

### Layer

Collection of neurons

define shape

### Regression vs Classification


## Network Types

- [Fully-Connected Neural Network](fully_connected.md): Translate a
vector of values into another vector of values

- [Convolutional Neural Network](cnn.md): Translate 1D (timeseries),
2D (images), or 3D (volumetric) data into a vector of values

- UNet: 2D to 2D translation
