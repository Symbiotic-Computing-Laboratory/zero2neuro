## Structure

Zero2Neuro is made up of three main modules and instructed by a corresponding configuration file for each. The three main modules are SuperDataSet, in charge of preparing data for an experiment, Network Builder, in charge of making the untrained model, and the Zero2Neuro engine, which performs the experiment itself. These three modules are what make Zero2Neuro a zero-code solution as they take care of the python code by taking in user-defined .txt configuration files.
