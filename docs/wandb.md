# Weights and Biases Support
Zero2Neuro supports the AI development tool [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) for use by the user. Once Weights and Biases is set up on the user's side they can enable it in their experiment by using the `--wandb` flag.

## What Weights & Biases Does
Weights & Biases provide an in-depth live overview of the model while it's training and compiles performance results in a dashboard format. It includes things such as training/validation/testing accuracy, model architecture, and system resource data.
