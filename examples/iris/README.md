# Example: Predicting The Type of Iris Flower

## Data
- File: [iris_data.csv](iris_data.csv)

## Network
- Sparse Categorical
- Four inputs
- Two hidden layers
- Three output layers

## Details
This model takes in the details of an iris flower and predicts which species it is out of three options. It uses sparse categorical which makes a prediction on which flower the model thinks is most likely.

## Experiment Suggestion
Try playing around with the hidden layers, see if the accuracy goes up any the more layers you have. Or see how few layers you need for an accurate model.
